    <h2 class="section-title">Extension Methods Used</h2>
    <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-item"><button class="accordion-header"><h3>K-Tip (Keratin Bond)</h3><span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button><div class="accordion-content"><p>K-Tip hair extensions, also known as keratin bonds or fusion extensions, are a popular method for adding length and volume to hair. This technique involves attaching individual strands of hair to a person's natural hair using a keratin-based adhesive. The keratin, a protein naturally found in hair, is melted using a specialized heating tool, allowing the extension to be fused to the natural hair for a durable and seamless blend. The Application Process: A meticulous strand-by-strand application is the hallmark of K-Tip extensions. A trained and certified stylist will section the client's hair and, using a heating tool, soften the keratin tip of the extension. This melted keratin is then carefully molded around a small section of the client's natural hair, creating a strong, sealed bond. The process can take several hours to complete, depending on the desired thickness and length. Longevity and Maintenance: With proper care, K-Tip extensions can last anywhere from three to five months, and in some cases, even longer. As the natural hair grows, the bonds will move further down the hair shaft. regular maintenance appointments are not typically required for tightening, as the bonds are not reusable. Instead, the full set is removed and a new set is applied.</p></div></div>
        <div class="accordion-item"><button class="accordion-header"><h3>I-Tip & Nano Beads</h3><span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button><div class="accordion-content"><p>I-Tip, or Nano Bead, hair extensions are a popular and discreet method for adding length and volume to natural hair. This technique utilizes individual hair strands, each with a small, pointed tip, which are then attached to the natural hair using a tiny bead, often referred to as a nano ring or nano bead. What sets this method apart is that it is a "cold fusion" technique, meaning no heat or glue is required for application, making it a gentler option for hair. The Application Process The application of I-Tip extensions is a meticulous, strand-by-strand process performed by a trained stylist. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: Sectioning: The stylist begins by sectioning the client's hair horizontally. The top section of hair is clipped away, creating a clean working area. Threading the Bead: A small, silicone-lined bead (the nano ring) is threaded onto a small section of the client's natural hair using a special looping tool. The silicone lining helps to protect the natural hair and prevent slippage. Inserting the Extension: The I-Tip end of the hair extension is then inserted into the nano bead alongside the natural hair. Clamping: Using a special pair of pliers, the stylist clamps the nano bead firmly, securing the extension in place. The bead is pressed flat to create a secure and discreet bond. This process is repeated in rows across the head until the desired fullness and length are achieved. The application can take several hours, depending on the number of strands being installed.</p></div></div>
        <div class="accordion-item"><button class="accordion-header"><h3>Tape-In Extensions</h3><span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button><div class="accordion-content"><p>Tape-in hair extensions are a popular semi-permanent solution for adding instant volume, length, and even chemical-free color to your hair. This method involves sandwiching a thin section of your natural hair between two wefts of hair that are each attached to a small, medical-grade adhesive tab. Known for their relatively quick and straightforward application process, tape-ins offer a natural-looking and comfortable way to enhance your hairstyle. The Application Process The application of tape-in extensions is typically performed by a professional hairstylist and is known for being one of the faster extension methods. The process involves: Preparation: The stylist will start with clean, dry, and product-free hair to ensure a strong adhesive bond. Sectioning: The hair is carefully sectioned, usually starting from the bottom and working upwards. The top layers of hair are clipped away to create a clean line for application. The "Sandwich" Technique: The stylist takes a very thin, horizontal section of natural hair. One tape-in weft is applied underneath this section, close to the scalp, with the adhesive side facing up. Another tape-in weft is then placed directly on top, with the adhesive side facing down, effectively "sandwiching" the natural hair in between. Securing the Bond: The two wefts are then firmly pressed together, often with a special tool, to create a secure and flat bond.</p></div></div>
        <div class="accordion-item"><button class="accordion-header"><h3>Hand-Tied Wefts</h3><span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button><div class="accordion-content"><p>Hand-tied wefts are a premium hair extension method highly sought after for their natural appearance and comfortable wear. Unlike machine-made wefts, hand-tied wefts are meticulously crafted by hand, with each individual hair strand tied onto a thin, flexible seam. This delicate construction results in a weft that is significantly thinner and lighter, allowing it to lay flat against the scalp for a seamless and virtually undetectable blend with the natural hair. The Application Process: A Skillful Sewing Technique The most common and popular method for applying hand-tied wefts is the "beaded row" or "natural beaded row" technique. This process is intricate and requires a certified, experienced stylist to ensure the health of the natural hair and the longevity of the extensions. The application involves the following steps: Creating the Foundation: The stylist begins by sectioning the hair. A row of small, silicone-lined beads is then attached horizontally to the natural hair. These beads serve as the anchor points for the wefts. A thread is often woven through the beads to create a secure and stable track. Sewing the Wefts: Once the beaded foundation is in place, the hand-tied wefts are carefully sewn onto this track using a needle and thread. Stylists can stack multiple wefts on a single row to achieve the desired volume and color dimension. This sewing process distributes the weight of the extensions evenly across the row, minimizing tension on the natural hair. Blending and Styling: After the wefts are securely attached, the stylist will cut and blend the extensions to match the client's desired hairstyle, ensuring a flawless and natural look.</p></div></div>
